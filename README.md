1. Business Process
   
2. Requirements: For the data from the years 2013 to 2023, I aim to analyze the impact of changes in water consumption costs on consumer behavior. Specifically, I want to understand how fluctuations in water consumption costs affect consumer spending habits and overall water usage patterns.
   
3. Get Data and Profiling the Data: Obtain the water consumption and cost data from the provided dataset: Water Consumption and Cost 2013-2020.
Source price data for essential utilities such as electricity and gas to further analyze their relationship with water consumption costs.
Perform data profiling to include the following for each billing cycle:
a) Water consumption volume
b) Total water consumption cost
c) Average electricity cost
d) Average gas cost
e) Total utility cost.
For each distinct billing cycle, calculate the minimum, maximum, and average values for water consumption volume, total water consumption cost, average electricity cost, average gas cost, and total utility cost.

5. Data Sources: Dataset for water consumption and cost data.
